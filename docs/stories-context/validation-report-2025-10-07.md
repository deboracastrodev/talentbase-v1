## Failed Items
None - All requirements fully met

## Partial Items
None - All requirements fully met

## Recommendations
1. Must Fix: None - validation passed completely
2. Should Improve: Consider adding more code references if additional modules need modification
3. Consider: Could expand test ideas to cover edge cases and error scenarios
